-> C Series - “Pizza box” servers which look like your traditional rack mounted server.
-> B Series - Blade servers which slide into the slots of a UCS chassis.
-> There are two types of B Series servers - half width and full width.

-> from one febric interconnect , how many servers we can manage.-> upto 20 chassis, each chassis have 8 blades.(160 servers)
-> VICs are used to present virtual adapters (vNICs & vHBAs) to the Operating System(s) installed on the UCS servers.
-> In regards to B-Series servers, VICs also provide the connectivity between the server and the UCS Chassis’s FEXs/IOMs.
-> IOMs are inserted into a UCS Chassis and are used to provide the physical connectivity between B-Series servers and the Fabric Interconnects (FIs).
-> The IOMs  are required because B-Series servers do not have any external ports. Instead, their VIC card(s) connect internally to the IOMs,
 which in turn connect to the FIs. The FIs then provide connectivity to the outside world. By “outside world” I mean systems which reside outside of the UCS platform.

-> The FIs are at the top of the “tree”. They provide connectivity to the outside world.
-> The IOMs provide the physical connectivity between the FIs and the VICs.
-> vNICs and vHBAs are created ontop of the VICs.
-> The (virtual) vNICs and vHBAs are presented to the Operating System as physical interfaces.

-> A virtual network interface card (vNIC) or virtual host bus adapter (vHBA) logically connects a virtual machine to a virtual interface 
on the UCS 6100/6200 series fabric interconnect and allows the virtual machine to send and receive traffic through that interface.

-> Service Profiles are the fundamental mechanism by which the Cisco Unified Computing System models the necessary abstractions of server, storage, and networking.

///////////////////////////////blade server vs rack servers//////////////////////////////////////

-> Rackmount servers are self-sufficient meaning the cooling, power supplies, hard disks, processors, memory, raid controller are all enclosed within that single server.
-> Rack servers are economical and great choice if your server requirement is small. You can simply plug the rack mounted server into a standard electrical outlet 
   and connect the network cables and the device is operational. 

-> effective computer network option for small to medium-sized operations. 

->  Blade servers only have CPUs, memory, network controllers, storage drives. 

-> ucs support local switching , so if one blad wants to send data to another blade, than packets go through febric interconnect reciver blade locally.



-> what are the component of ucs manager.
-> what are the diff commponent in cs servr.
diff kind of ucs servers.
what are the hardwares are availables.
what are the available type 1 hypervisort and type 2
what is virtulization
what is SAN.


-> fabric interconnect have 40 ports or 20 ports. 
-> one febric interconnect can connect up to 20 chassis and one chassis have 8 blade servers.so total of 160 blade servers we can handels.
-> if servers requirements is more than can we required more febric intrconnect. if true than who manage this fabric intrconnects?
-> can we put more than 8 blade servers in a chassis. if yes, than why we cant put.
-> If the fabric extender is connected to fabric interconnect using 4 links and one of the links fail, what will happen?
