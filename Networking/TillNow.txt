UCSM (Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager) : Computing, network and storage

Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager provides unified, embedded management of all software and hardware components in the Cisco UCS.
 Using SingleConnect Technology it controls multiple chassis and manages resources for thousands of virtual machines.

chassis : binding thousands of Cisco UCS components together.

mainframe computers
tower and rack servers
blade servers

The Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is a data center server computer product line composed of computing hardware, 
virtualization support, switching fabric, and management software introduced in 2009 by Cisco Systems.
The products are marketed for scalability by integrating many components of a data center that can be managed as a single unit.



The Cisco fabric interconnects (FI) provide network connectivity for the chassis, blade servers and rack servers 
connected to it through different speeds of Ethernet and Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE).

Management of the system devices is handled by the UCS Manager software integrated with fabric interconnects.

IOM -> i/o module ,FEX -> febric extender.

UUIds : Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)
NIC -> network interface cards
MAC -> Media Access Controll
WWN -> Word wide Node

 Computer Architecture
  ====================
1. What is multi processor systems?
2. What is the difference between multicore and multiprocessor?
3. What is the difference between Desktop and Server at hardware level?
4. What is PCI slot?
5. What is IPMI? 
6. What all are the IO cards available? What is its use?


2)))
 Networking : 
1) Storage and its types    
2) LUN    
3) IOPS    
4) hard disk drives (HDD)     
5) solid state drives (SDD)    
6) Update C++ code using class and method.    
7) Writed some more basic code using C++ to understand the pointer.


3)))
1) Done with gdb.( online compiler and debugger for C/C++ )

2) Exploring physical architecture of UCS. 
  -> Fabric Interconnects. 
  -> Blade servers.
  -> Rack-mount servers. 
  -> IOM modules.
3) Exploring multithreding using Cpp.

4)))

Done with basic of Multithreading :

1) Creating threads.
2) join and detach the threads.
3) Mutex : Mutual Exclusion in thread, Race Condition.  
 -> try_lock  -> Timed Mutex  
 -> Recursive Mutex  
 -> Lock Guard
4) Deadlock.
5) Process Synchronization.



Basic of operating system :
what is operating system.
types of operating system.
multitasking,multithreading, multiprocessing
CPU scheduling
process synchronization


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Socket Programming : 
-> explore and understand the basic function of socket programming 
     also run a code for client & server communication :
1) Server :
??socket -> open socket with internet address
 
bind -> bind the socket with ip address and port
listen -> for listening the request
accept -> create a new socket descriptor to handle the new connection from client
send -> send message to client
recv -> received message from client
close -> close the socket descriptor

2) client :
socket -> open socket with internet address
connect -> connect to the server on the socket
send -> send message to server
recv -> received message from server
close -> close the socket descriptor

sockaddr_in -> struct type used to set IP address, port and IP address family.

Task Completed :
Oops :
1) Classes 
2) Objects
3) Constructor
4) Destructor
5) Access Modifiers : public, protected, private
6) Inheritance : Modes(public, protected, private), Type (single, multiple,multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid)
7) Polymorphism : compile time, run time
8) Encapsulation 
9) Abstraction
10) Structure
